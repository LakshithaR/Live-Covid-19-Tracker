Live Covid-19 Statistical Data

The ALL INDIA COVID-19 LIVE REPORT projects presents the user the live updates of the novel Coronavirus (a.k.a Covid-19) in a way which is easily understood by all. It displays both graphical as well as numerical data state wise. This project has been very responsive as it creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the orientation and screen size of the device being used to view it. This has been achieved by using Media Query and Flex. The main page contains the Home Screen, About and Statewise Statistics. The statistical data (in home screen) mainly throws light on the number of cases Confirmed,  Active, Recovered, and Deceased. A tabular array of the same has also set forth Zone Wise. We have used Graph(Chart) to provide statistical data. Zonal Wise Data helps in better ananlysis as well as comparison of cases. The live data report was extracted from https://api.covid19india.org/data.json .HTML, CSS and Javascript was used in creating this project. 


The main aim of this study is to have an expanding knowledge about this deadly virus as new data is presented. Be mentally and physically prepared. A reference of pattern and behaviors can help us to analyze future pandemics
