# Live-Covid-19-Tracker
Live Covid-19 Statistical Data


Main Aim of this Project is to present the Live Covid-19 Data
to our users in a way which is easily understood by all.

We have used Graph(chart) to provide statistical data of number of Confirmed,
Active, Recovered and Deceased Cases of all the States (including
Union Territories) across India. Further, we have also given Zonal Wise 
breakup which will help in easy analysis of cases. All the live data for this 
Project is accesed from-
https://api.covid19india.org/data.json

With the help of HTML, CSS and JS we have developed this entire 
Project.
